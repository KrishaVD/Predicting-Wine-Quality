# Wine_Quality

In this project, I wanted to predict the quality of wine; I created two groups labelling them as "good" and "bad" and I set up to bins to classify them into. If the quality of the wine is between 7 and 8, it is labelled as "good" wine but if it is below 7, then it is labelled as "bad" wine. 

I have kept the bins spread quite high (making only the quality with 7s and 8s to be labelled as the "good" wine but it can be altered if you wish). I have used Matplotlib and Seaborn to get a good picture of how much of the "good" and "bad" wine present in the dataset.

After seperating the features I want to use to predict the quality of the wine and then the quality of the wine itself, 

Random Forest Classification Model in ML to predict whether a certain is "good" or "bad" by creating bins.
